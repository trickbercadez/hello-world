Hi Everyone!

John Patrick is my name, currently working as a Loan officer at lending company.
I graduated at GIST and took Information Technology System.
too far from the position where I am.
Pandemic makes me realized to pursue what I really want to achieve in life,
and this is it, hello to new beginning.
